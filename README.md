# localhost/phpmyadmin

"localhost/phpmyadmin" is a web-based application used for managing MySQL and MariaDB databases. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing databases, tables, and other database-related tasks.

To access localhost/phpmyadmin (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/web-apply/localhost-phpmyadmin/main/localhost-phpmyadmin.pdf) , you need to have a local server installed on your computer such as XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP.

To create a new article, you would typically use a Content Management System (CMS) such as WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal. These CMSs have built-in editors and interfaces for creating new articles and managing content.

If you want to create a custom article management system, you would need to use a programming language such as PHP, along with a database management system such as MySQL or MariaDB, to create a custom solution. This would require some programming skills and knowledge of databases and web development.






# Localhost/Phpmyadmin Setup
How to install phpMyAdmin is one of the most frequently asked questions. No files are required for installation. However, it may seem a little confusing for those who do not know the installation. A compressed folder will come up when you download.

You need to open the files contained in it and save them in your web server folder. The installation process for most software is almost the same. First you need to configure. You should open the config file located in the downloaded folder.

Change the line that continues as cfg ['Pmaâ€¦] to http://localhost/phpmyadmin. Then, you should make sure that the lines that start in the same way are written as root in the user part. If it says root in the user section, you should check whether the password section is empty.

If you see the interface of the software when you save and close the file and go to the localhost/phpmyadmin domain name, you have done it correctly.

Mobile application installation is also quite simple. You can access the application by downloading the application from the store of your Android or IOS device.
